                        <p>The technique of protecting networks, computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, and data from hostile intrusions is known as cyber security. It is often referred to as electronic information security or information technology security. The phrase can be broken down into a few basic categories and is used in a wide range of applications, including business and mobile computing.</p>
                        <p><ul>
                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Network security is the act of protecting a computer network from intruders, including malicious software that seizes opportunities or targeted attacks, is known as network security.</p></li>
                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Application Security focuses on protecting devices and software from threats. The data that an application is meant to safeguard may be accessible if it is compromised. Effective security starts at the design phase, long before a program or gadget is put into use.</p></li>
                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Information security ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data while it is in storage and transit.</p></li>
                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Operational security involves the procedures and judgments used to manage and safeguard data assets. This includes the policies that regulate how and where data may be stored or exchanged, as well as the permissions people have when accessing a network.</p></li>
                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Disaster recovery and business continuity involves the procedures and judgments used to manage and safeguard data assets. This includes the policies that regulate how and where data may be stored or exchanged, as well as the permissions people have when accessing a network.</p></li>
                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">End-user education handles the component in cyber security that is most unpredictable: people. Anyone who disregards sound security procedures has the potential to unintentionally introduce a virus into a system that is otherwise secure. For the security of any firm, it is crucial to teach users to delete suspicious email attachments, to avoid plugging in unknown USB drives, and other key teachings.</p></li>

                        </ul></p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How serious the cyber threat is?</h2>
                        <p>The amount of data breaches each year is increasing as the worldwide cyber threat develops quickly. According to a survey from RiskBased Security, data breaches have exposed an astonishing 7.9 billion records in just the first nine months of 2019. This number is more than twice (112%) as many records as were revealed during the same time period in 2018.</p>
                        <p>The most breaches happened in the medical industry, retail, and public sector, with malicious criminals being most often to blame. Because they gather financial and medical data, some of these industries are more interesting to cybercriminals than others, but any firms that use networks might be the target of customer data theft, corporate espionage, or customer attacks.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/cybersecurity.jpg" alt="..." />
                        <p>The International Data Corporation projects that by 2022, global spending on cyber-security solutions would amount to a staggering $133.7 billion, as the scope of the cyber threat is expected to grow. In response to the growing cyber danger, governments all over the world have issued recommendations to support businesses in putting good cyber-security policies into place.</p>

                        <p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the US has developed a framework for cyber security. The architecture suggests constant, real-time monitoring of all electronic resources to prevent the spread of harmful code and help in early identification.</p>
                        <p>The U.K.'s "10 steps to cyber security" guidelines reiterate the significance of system monitoring. governmental National Cyber Security Center The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) in Australia frequently issues guidelines on how businesses can defend against the newest cyber-security threats.</p>
