                        <p>A malicious act that aims to destroy data, steal data, or otherwise interfere with digital life is referred to as a cyber or cybersecurity threat. Computer viruses, data breaches, DoS assaults, and other attack methods are examples of cyberthreats.</p>
                        <p>An information technology asset, computer network, piece of intellectual property, or any other kind of sensitive data could be the target of a successful cyber attack that tries to steal, destroy, or disrupt information technology. This is referred to as a cyber threat. <a href="../2511352">Cyberthreats</a> may originate from reputable people inside a company or from unidentified parties in distant areas.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Where Do Cyber Threats Come From?</h2>
                        <p>There are several threat actors who use computer systems, including:</p>

                        <h4>Hostile Nation-States</h4>
                        <p>Emerging cyber dangers include propaganda, website vandalism, espionage, disruption of critical infrastructure, and even human casualties, according to national cyber warfare programs. When compared to other threat actors, government-sponsored programs are becoming more sophisticated and pose advanced dangers. Their expanding capabilities might seriously harm the long-term security of several nations, including the United States. Due to their ability to use technology and techniques against the most challenging targets, such as classified networks and crucial infrastructure like electrical grids and gas control valves, hostile nation-states offer the greatest risk.</p>

                        <h4>Terrorist Groups</h4>
                        <p>Terrorist organizations are increasingly harming national interests by deploying cyberattacks. Compared to nation-states, they are less skilled in cyberattacks and less likely to use them. As more technically minded generations join their ranks, it is anticipated that terrorist organizations will pose significant cyber dangers.</p>

                        <h4>Corporate Spies and Organized Crime Organizations</h4>
                        <p>Due to their capacity for industrial espionage to steal trade secrets or massive financial thievery, corporate spies and organized criminal groups constitute a risk. The majority of the time, these parties are focused on generating a profit or impeding a company's capacity to generate a profit by targeting competitors' vital infrastructure, acquiring trade secrets, or getting access to and using extortion to obtain information.</p>

                        <h4>Hacktivists</h4>
                        <p>The political ideas and concerns that hacktivists engage in are diverse. The majority of hacktivist organizations are more interested in disseminating propaganda than in destroying infrastructure or interfering with services. Instead of doing the most harm to an institution, their aim is to further their political objective.</p>

                        <h4>Disgruntled Insiders</h4>
                        <p>Insiders who are dissatisfied frequently commit cybercrime. Because they could already have permission to access the data, insiders frequently don't need a high level of technical expertise to reveal critical information. Third-party suppliers and staff members who may unintentionally inject malware into systems or who may log into a secure S3 bucket, extract its contents, and post them online in order to cause a data breach are also considered insider risks. S3 permissions must be checked, or else someone else will.</p>

                        <h4>Hackers</h4>
                        <p>A zero-day exploit could be used by malicious attackers to access data without authorization. For a challenge or bragging reasons, hackers may breach into computer systems. This used to require a lot of talent. Today, sophisticated attacks are made simple by the availability of automated attack scripts and protocols that may be downloaded from the Internet.</p>

                        <h4>Natural Disasters</h4>
                        <p>Because they have the same potential to damage your vital infrastructure as a cyber attack, natural disasters pose a threat to the internet.</p>

                        <h4>Accidental Actions of Authorized Users</h4>
                        <p>A potential data breach could result from an authorized user failing to configure S3 security properly. Instead of hackers or unhappy insiders, some of the worst data breaches have been the result of bad configuration.</p>

                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for. I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can’t stop us all… after all, we’re all alike. - The Mentor (Loyd Blankenship)</blockquote>

                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Wiper Attacks</p>- A malware assault known as a "wiper" aims to delete everything on the infected computer's hard disk.</li>

                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Intellectual Property Theft</p>- Intellectual property theft is the taking or unauthorized use of another person's intellectual property.</li>

                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Data Manipulation</p>- Data manipulation is a type of cyberattack that seeks to manipulate the data rather than steal it in order to make it more difficult for an organization to function.</li>

                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Data Destruction</p>- When a cyberattacker tries to remove data, that is considered data destruction.</li>

                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Drive-by Downloads</p>- A drive-by download attack is when a person unknowingly downloads something, frequently installing malware, spyware, or a computer virus.</li>

                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Malvertising</p>- Malvertising is the practice of using web marketing to disseminate malware.</li>

                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Rogue Software</p>- Malware that passes for legitimate software is known as rogue software.</li>

                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Unpatched Software</p>- Malware that passes for legitimate software is known as rogue software.</li>

                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Data Centre Disrupted by Natural Disaster</p>- An environmental catastrophe like flooding could affect the data center where your software is kept.</li>

                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Social Engineering Attacks</p>- Social engineering attacks persuade users to do activities that are advantageous to the attacker or reveal sensitive information by using psychological manipulation.</li>

                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Software Supply Chain Attacks</p>- A cyberattack on a company that focuses on the vulnerable points in its reliable software update and supply chain is known as a software supply chain assault. The network of all people, businesses, resources, tasks, activities and technological advancements involved in the production and distribution of a good is known as a supply chain. </li>

                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)</p>- Attackers may exfiltrate critical data while purposefully avoiding discovery by the organization's security team when a person or group acquires unauthorized access to a network and goes for a lengthy period of time without being found. APTs usually target nation states, major organizations, or other extremely valuable targets since they demand highly skilled attackers and significant effort.</li>

                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)</p>- In order to prevent users from accessing a target system, a denial of service (DoS) assault aims to overtax its resources and render it unusable. In a distributed denial of service (DDoS) assault, the target system is subjected to a coordinated attack from a large number of compromised computers or other devices.</li>

                            <li><p class="font-weight-bold">Man-in-the-Middle Attack (MitM)</p>- Users and devices that contact a remote system through the internet typically operate under the assumption that they are interacting directly with the target system's server. Attackers will shatter this assumption when they carry out a Man in the Middle attack by inserting themselves between the user and the target service.</li>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">How to Protect Against and Identify Cyber Threats</h2>
                        <p>A cyber threat intelligence exercise and the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework are useful places to start when learning how to safeguard your firm from cyber threats.</p>

                        <p>After being gathered, considered, and analyzed, cyber threat information becomes cyber threat intelligence. Cyber threat information helps you better comprehend cyber risks and enables you to accurately and quickly spot the similarities and differences between various cyber threat types.</p>

                        <p>The reason the process is circular is because you could find cybersecurity gaps, unanswered questions, or be urged to acquire new needs and repeat the intelligence cycle while gathering or evaluating the information.</p>
